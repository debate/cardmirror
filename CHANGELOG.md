# Changelog

User-facing release notes for CardMirror. Each entry lists the
behavior, features, or bug fixes a release brought; rationale and
internal refactors live in commit messages, not here.

## Unreleased

- New setting: **default file format for new docs**. Pick `.docx`
  (default — Word- / Verbatim-compatible) or `.cmir` (CardMirror's
  native format, enables autosave); the Save-As dialog defaults to
  that format for any doc that doesn't yet have an on-disk handle.
  Existing files on disk still re-save in whatever format they were
  opened from.
- New setting: **jump to doc top when read mode toggles**. Off by
  default (today's stay-put behavior). When on, toggling read mode
  in either direction scrolls to the top of the doc and places the
  cursor at the start.
- Zoom in / out / reset and the highlight / shading paint-mode
  toggles are now registered ribbon commands, so users can bind
  them to keys via Settings → Keybindings. Default bindings:
  `Mod-=` for zoom in, `Mod--` for zoom out; `zoomReset` and the
  paintbrush toggles ship unbound (`Mod-0` is a browser-level
  reset that Chromium won't always let the page intercept, so the
  status-bar reset button remains the discoverable affordance).
- Keyboard-shortcut command labels (Settings → Keybindings) now
  use consistent title casing across the board.
- **Find and Replace** (Ctrl-F / Ctrl-H). Floating bar in the
  upper-right with case-sensitive and whole-word toggles, next /
  prev navigation, a match count, Replace, and Replace All. Every
  match is highlighted in light yellow in the doc; the
  currently-active one gets a stronger orange band so you can
  see what Replace will touch. Escape closes the bar and
  restores focus to the editor. (Nav-pane integration and
  categorized vs proximity result ordering are still on the
  wishlist for a future release.)
- Re-pressing a heading shortcut (F4 / F5 / F6 / F7 / Mod-F7 /
  Mod-F8) on a paragraph that already has that heading style now
  strips the paragraph's indentation while keeping the heading
  style and all other formatting intact, instead of being a
  no-op.
- Opening a doc now starts both the editor and the nav pane
  scrolled to the top, instead of inheriting the previous doc's
  scroll position.
- A "New document" window spawned while CardMirror is already
  running no longer offers to "recover" the docs you have open
  in other windows. Only the first window of an app session
  surfaces the startup-recovery sidebar.
- The AI alt-text generator now ships surrounding context with the
  image — the enclosing card's tag and cite, plus the paragraphs
  immediately before and after the image — so descriptions reflect
  what the image is *doing* in the argument instead of generic
  "a chart with bars" captions.
- Shift-F3 (cycle case) now keeps the selection after each press,
  so the user can re-press to advance to the next case state
  (lower → UPPER → Title → lower) without re-selecting.
- Speech-doc designation now uses the same warm-gold accent in both
  single-window multi-window mode (the banner under the ribbon) and
  single-window multi-pane mode (the per-pane chip), so the "this
  is the speech doc" affordance reads the same regardless of window
  topology.
- Ribbon cleanup: the plain-paste toggle (`T`) is hidden on desktop
  (F2 reads the clipboard directly there — no armed state to show),
  and the autosave toggle (⏱) is hidden on the web edition
  (autosave requires an on-disk file handle, which the browser
  can't provide).

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-05-16

First downloadable preview of CardMirror. **This is an alpha.**
Expect bugs, missing features, and occasional breakage. Don't use
it for tournament-day work yet; keep a Verbatim copy of anything
important.

What works:

- Open and save Microsoft Word `.docx` files. Round-trips against
  Verbatim-format docs.
- Native `.cmir` format for lossless save / restore (no Word
  conversion costs, autosave-eligible).
- Verbatim-parity editing model: Pocket / Hat / Block / Tag /
  Analytic / Undertag styles, F-key shortcuts, condense /
  uncondense / case-toggle, emphasis / underline / highlight,
  shrink, send-to-speech, paste-as-plain.
- Multi-doc workspace — pick between a three-pane single-window
  layout or one window per doc.
- Send-to-speech across windows in multi-window mode.
- Per-doc read mode and autosave.
- Crash-recovery journal — unsaved drafts come back on next
  launch.
- Word-style left navigation pane: outline view, multi-select,
  drag-reorder.

Not in this release (planned):

- Full-text and schema-aware search across open docs / the
  evidence library on disk.
- Transclusion (live-linked content from a source doc).
- Cross-window drag-and-drop. (Cross-pane drag within multi-pane
  mode works.)

Operational:

- **Crash dumps** are collected locally to disk only — never
  uploaded anywhere. If CardMirror crashes and you want to send
  a report, open *Help → Open Crash Dumps Folder* and attach
  the minidump to a GitHub issue.
- **Auto-update**: on launch, CardMirror checks GitHub Releases
  for a newer version and downloads it in the background. When
  one's ready, a dialog asks whether to restart now or install
  on next quit. *Help → Check for Updates…* triggers the same
  check on demand.

Platforms:

- **macOS** — `.dmg` for Intel (x64) and Apple Silicon (arm64).
- **Windows** — NSIS installer (`.exe`) for x64.
- **Linux** — `.AppImage` (distribution-agnostic) and `.pacman`
  (Arch-native; install with `sudo pacman -U file.pacman`) for
  x64.

Known gaps:

- Desktop builds are unsigned. First-launch warnings on
  Windows (SmartScreen) and macOS (Gatekeeper) require a
  right-click → Open. See README.
